                    In communications and information processing, code is a
                    system of rules to convert information—such as a letter,
                    word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes
                    shortened or secret, for communication through a
                    communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An
                    early example is the invention of language, which enabled a
                    person, through speech, to communicate what they thought,
                    saw, heard or felt to others. But speech limits the range of
                    communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits
                    the audience to those present when the speech is uttered .
                    The invention of writing, which converted spoken language
                    into visual symbols, extended the range of communication
                    across space and time. The process of encoding converts
                    information from a source into symbols for communication or
                    storage. Decoding is the reverse process, converting code
                    symbols back into a form that the recipient understands,
                    such as English or/and Spanish. One reason for coding is to
                    enable communication in places where ordinary plain
                    language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For
                    example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by
                    a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of
                    the message, typically individual letters and numbers.
                    Another person standing a great distance away can interpret
                    the flags and reproduce the words sent.
